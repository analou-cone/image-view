# Random Picture Viewer

The goal is that we can point our app at a directory with graphic images in it, and
we will show them one at a time in random order.

These are the external dependencies we have pulled in.

 * Mirror.js - to make simple React+Redux. https://github.com/mirrorjs/mirror -
   more docs at https://github.com/mirrorjs/mirror/blob/master/docs/api.md
 * Skeleton CSS - to make UI and layout simple. http://getskeleton.com/

## Project Goals

To learn React.js, Redux, Javascript, and programming. This is a very beginning
React framework too.

## Operational Guide

### yarn start
Starts the development server.

### yarn build
Bundles the app into static files for production.

### yarn test
Starts the test runner.

### yarn eject
Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!
